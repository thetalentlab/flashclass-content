# code samples for flashclass

these files are samples of what we may decide to load into flashclass for new users

there is a single `samples-01` folder with 3 subfolders, each of these with 30 fragments and related markdown for each

there are some differences in how these files were generated

these samples are open for discussion as flashclass develops
