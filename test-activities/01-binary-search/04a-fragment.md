# making sense of binary search
*binary search is an efficient search algorithm*

<br>
<br>

> Take the example of finding a *name* in a *phonebook*

<br>

This problem can be solved using binary search because:

1. the phonebook lists peoples' `NAMES`
2. the phonebook names are ordered `ALPHABETICALLY`
3. the phonebook allows you to open `ANY PAGE`
