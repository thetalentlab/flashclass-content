*recognizing Turing completeness*

<br>

Around 1950, Alan Turing came up with an idea that shaped a century of computing

> *"A Turing machine is not intelligent, but simulates intelligence by following LOGICAL steps, making DECISIONS based on DATA and LOOPING through these steps as long as necessary.
> <br><br>
> The whole notion of Turing completeness is that any computation that can be done by one machine can be done by any other Turing complete machine."*

3 ingredients of a Turing complete machine:

```md {0|1|1-2|1-3}
1. DATA:      how the machine receives, remembers and returns information
2. DECISIONS: how the machine applies logic to do its job
3. LOOPS:     how the machine repeats necessary steps as many times as needed
```
