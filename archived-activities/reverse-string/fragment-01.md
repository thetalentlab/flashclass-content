# Variant 1: Reverse String Using Slicing

This variant of the reverse string algorithm uses Python's slicing feature to reverse the string in a single line. Slicing is an efficient way to reverse a string as it directly accesses elements by index.

### Characteristics:
- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(n)
- **Style:** Simple and idiomatic, uses slicing
