# Variant 15: Bubble Sort Using Adaptive Mid-Point Comparison

In this variant, instead of comparing adjacent elements, the bubble sort algorithm compares each element with a mid-point element of the unsorted portion of the array. This changes the way elements are "bubbled" through the array and can lead to different sorting behaviors, though it does not improve the algorithm's overall time complexity.

### Characteristics:
- **Time Complexity:** O(n^2)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)
- **Style:** Iterative, uses adaptive mid-point comparison
