# Variant 19: Bubble Sort with Multiple Passes in Each Iteration

In this variant, the bubble sort algorithm performs two passes over the unsorted portion of the array during each iteration. This modification increases the number of comparisons, but also increases the likelihood that elements will be in their correct position sooner. However, it does not change the overall time complexity of the algorithm.

### Characteristics:
- **Time Complexity:** O(n^2)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)
- **Style:** Iterative, multiple passes per iteration
