# Variant 28: Bubble Sort with Multiple Pivots

This variant uses multiple pivots during each pass of the bubble sort algorithm. Randomly chosen pivots are compared and swapped if necessary, introducing additional randomness into the process. This variant adds complexity and doesn't improve the worst-case performance but offers a different perspective on how elements can be sorted.

### Characteristics:
- **Time Complexity:** O(n^2)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)
- **Style:** Iterative, uses multiple pivots
