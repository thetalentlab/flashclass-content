# Variant 24: Bubble Sort Using Binary Search for Insertion

This variant integrates a binary search to find the correct position for each element during the bubble sort process. Instead of performing adjacent swaps, it inserts each element into its correct position in the sorted portion of the array, similar to insertion sort but maintaining the bubble sort iterative structure.

### Characteristics:
- **Time Complexity:** O(n^2)
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) due to list slicing
- **Style:** Iterative, integrates binary search for insertion
