# Variant 16: Bubble Sort with Cyclic Swaps

This variant of bubble sort introduces a cyclic swap mechanism, where the first element is cycled to the last position at the end of each outer loop iteration. This approach gives the algorithm a different flavor of sorting, though it doesn't affect the overall time complexity and is more of an experimental variation.

### Characteristics:
- **Time Complexity:** O(n^2)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)
- **Style:** Iterative, experimental cyclic swap
