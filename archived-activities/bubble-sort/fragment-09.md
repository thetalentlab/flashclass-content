# Variant 9: Bubble Sort Using List Comprehension

This variant of bubble sort leverages list comprehension for the inner loop. The list comprehension checks each pair of elements and swaps them if necessary, constructing a new list at each iteration. While this is not the most efficient way to implement bubble sort, it showcases the use of Python's list comprehensions in a non-trivial way.

### Characteristics:
- **Time Complexity:** O(n^2)
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) due to the creation of new lists
- **Style:** Iterative, creative use of list comprehension
