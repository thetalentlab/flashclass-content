# Binary Search Using Bitwise Operators

## Summary

This variant demonstrates how bitwise operations can be used in algorithmic contexts, specifically for calculating the midpoint in binary search. While the performance gain in Python may be minimal, this approach showcases an alternative method that can be beneficial in certain programming environments where efficiency is critical.

## Description

This variant of binary search uses a bitwise right-shift operator (`>>`) to calculate the middle index. The expression `((right - left) >> 1)` is equivalent to dividing by 2, but using bitwise operations can be faster in certain low-level programming contexts. This variant demonstrates the use of bitwise operations in an algorithmic context, though in Python, the performance gain may be minimal.

## Explanation

1. **Initialization**:
   - The `left` pointer is initialized to the start of the array (`0`), and the `right` pointer is initialized to the end of the array (`len(arr) - 1`).

2. **Binary Search Loop**:
   - The loop continues as long as the `left` pointer is less than or equal to the `right` pointer, ensuring there is still a valid range to search within.

3. **Midpoint Calculation Using Bitwise Operator**:
   - The midpoint is calculated using the bitwise right-shift operator: `mid = left + ((right - left) >> 1)`. This operation is equivalent to dividing `(right - left)` by 2, but using bitwise operations can be faster in certain low-level contexts.

4. **Target Comparison**:
   - If `arr[mid]` matches the `target`, the function returns the index `mid`.
   - If `arr[mid]` is less than `target`, the search continues in the right half by adjusting the `left` pointer.
   - If `arr[mid]` is greater, the search continues in the left half by adjusting the `right` pointer.

5. **Termination**:
   - If the loop exits without finding the target, the function returns `-1`, indicating that the target is not present in the array.

6. **Example Usage**:
   - The function can be used by passing an array and a target value. If the target is found within the array, its index is returned; otherwise, `-1` is returned.

## Characteristics

- **Time Complexity:** O(log n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)
- **Style:** Iterative, uses bitwise operations
