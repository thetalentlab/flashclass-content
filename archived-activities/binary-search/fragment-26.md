# Binary Search with Adaptive Midpoint Calculation

## Summary

This version of binary search uses an adaptive midpoint calculation that adjusts based on the values in the array. This approach can potentially speed up the search in cases where the values are not uniformly distributed, though it introduces complexity compared to the traditional binary search. The detailed comments and debugging output help illustrate how the adaptive midpoint works and how it impacts the search process. This variant is useful for understanding how different midpoint calculations can influence the efficiency of a binary search.

## Description

This variant uses an adaptive calculation for the midpoint based on the values of `target`, `arr[left]`, and `arr[right]`. The midpoint is adjusted according to the distribution of values in the array, potentially speeding up the search when values are not uniformly distributed. This can make the search more efficient in certain cases but is more complex and less general than the traditional midpoint calculation.

## Explanation

1. **Initialization**:
   - **Left Pointer**: Set to `0`, representing the start of the array.
   - **Right Pointer**: Set to `len(arr) - 1`, representing the end of the array.

2. **Adaptive Midpoint Calculation**:
   - The adaptive midpoint calculation is based on the assumption that the array's values are linearly distributed. The formula `mid = left + (right - left) * (target - arr[left]) // (arr[right] - arr[left])` tries to estimate the position of the target more accurately than the traditional midpoint.
   - **Division by Zero Avoidance**: If `arr[right] == arr[left]`, the adaptive calculation is not valid (all elements in the range are the same), so it falls back to the traditional midpoint calculation.
   - **Bounds Check**: The calculated midpoint might exceed the bounds, so it is clamped between `left` and `right` using `mid = max(left, min(mid, right))`.

3. **Debugging Output**:
   - The `print` statement outputs the current `left`, `right`, and `mid` indices, along with the value at `mid`, to help visualize how the adaptive midpoint changes during the search.

4. **Target Comparison**:
   - **Target Found**: If `arr[mid]` equals the `target`, the function returns `mid`, the index where the target is found.
   - **Target Greater**: If `arr[mid]` is less than `target`, the search space is reduced to the right half by moving the `left` pointer to `mid + 1`.
   - **Target Smaller**: If `arr[mid]` is greater than `target`, the search space is reduced to the left half by moving the `right` pointer to `mid - 1`.

5. **Termination**:
   - The loop exits when `left` exceeds `right`, meaning the search space is exhausted. If this happens without finding the target, return `-1` to indicate that the target is not in the array.

6. **Example Usage**:
   - The function can be used by passing a sorted array and a target value. If the target is found, the function returns its index; otherwise, it returns `-1`.
