# Binary Search with Custom Mid Calculation Using Logarithm

## Summary

This variant showcases a unique way to calculate the midpoint in binary search using logarithms. While this approach is unconventional and not typically necessary, it illustrates the flexibility in designing algorithms and how different mathematical functions can influence the behavior of a standard algorithm like binary search.

## Description

This variant calculates the middle index using a logarithmic function. The middle index is computed as `mid = left + math.ceil((right - left) / math.log2(len(arr)))`. This approach demonstrates how different mathematical functions can be used to calculate the midpoint, potentially leading to different behaviors in the search process. While not typically necessary for binary search, it illustrates the flexibility in choosing midpoint calculations.

## Explanation

1. **Importing `math`**:
   - The `math` module is imported to utilize the logarithmic function for the custom midpoint calculation.

2. **Initialization**:
   - The `left` pointer is initialized to the start of the array (`0`), and the `right` pointer is initialized to the end of the array (`len(arr) - 1`).

3. **Binary Search Loop**:
   - The loop continues as long as the `left` pointer is less than or equal to the `right` pointer, ensuring that there is a valid range to search within.

4. **Custom Midpoint Calculation**:
   - The midpoint is calculated using a logarithmic function: `mid = left + math.ceil((right - left) / math.log2(len(arr)))`.
   - This calculation divides the range by the logarithm of the array length, providing a custom way to determine the midpoint.
   - The midpoint is then adjusted to ensure it remains within the current search bounds using `min(max(left, mid), right)` to handle any potential rounding issues.

5. **Target Comparison**:
   - If `arr[mid]` matches the `target`, the function returns the index `mid`.
   - If `arr[mid]` is less than `target`, the search continues in the right half by adjusting the `left` pointer.
   - If `arr[mid]` is greater, the search continues in the left half by adjusting the `right` pointer.

6. **Termination**:
   - If the loop exits without finding the target, the function returns `-1`, indicating that the target is not present in the array.

7. **Example Usage**:
   - The function can be used by passing an array and a target value. If the target is found within the array, its index is returned; otherwise, `-1` is returned.

## Characteristics
