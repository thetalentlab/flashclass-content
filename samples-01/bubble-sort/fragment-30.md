# Variant 30: Bubble Sort with Parallel Processing

This variant of bubble sort leverages parallel processing to perform the sorting process. The array is divided and sorted in parallel using Python's multiprocessing library. This approach can potentially improve performance on multi-core processors, though the overhead of managing processes often outweighs the benefits for small arrays.

### Characteristics:
- **Time Complexity:** O(n^2) in serial execution, may improve with parallel processing
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) due to parallel processing overhead
- **Style:** Parallel, uses multiprocessing for sorting
