# Variant 11: Bubble Sort Using NumPy

This variant of bubble sort utilizes the NumPy library to handle array operations. The list is first converted into a NumPy array, and then the bubble sort logic is applied. After sorting, the array is converted back to a list before being returned. This approach leverages NumPy's efficient array operations, though it doesn't change the algorithm's fundamental complexity.

### Characteristics:
- **Time Complexity:** O(n^2)
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) due to NumPy array conversion
- **Style:** Iterative, leverages NumPy for array operations
