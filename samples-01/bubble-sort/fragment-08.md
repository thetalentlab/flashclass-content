# Variant 8: Bubble Sort Using Python's Built-in Enumerate

This variant of bubble sort uses Python's `enumerate` function to iterate through the array. While the use of `enumerate` doesn't provide significant advantages in this context, it demonstrates how you can use this built-in function to simplify iteration, especially when the index is required.

### Characteristics:
- **Time Complexity:** O(n^2)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)
- **Style:** Iterative, using enumerate for iteration
