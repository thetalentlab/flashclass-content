# Variant 3: Bubble Sort in Reverse Order (Descending)

This variant of bubble sort is designed to sort the array in descending order. It uses the same logic as the basic bubble sort but changes the comparison to swap elements if the current element is less than the next one, effectively "bubbling" the smallest element to the end of the array with each pass.

### Characteristics:
- **Time Complexity:** O(n^2)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)
- **Style:** Iterative, descending order
