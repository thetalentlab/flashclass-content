# Variant 4: Bubble Sort with a Different Swap Mechanism

This variant of bubble sort swaps elements using a temporary variable instead of Python's tuple unpacking. While functionally identical to the basic version, this approach illustrates a more explicit swap process that might be more familiar to those coming from languages that don't support tuple unpacking.

### Characteristics:
- **Time Complexity:** O(n^2)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)
- **Style:** Iterative, explicit swap mechanism
