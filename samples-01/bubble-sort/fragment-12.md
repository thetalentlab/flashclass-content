# Variant 12: Bubble Sort with a Custom Comparator

This variant allows a custom comparator function to be passed into the bubble sort algorithm. The comparator determines how two elements are compared, providing flexibility for sorting based on different criteria (e.g., sorting objects based on a specific attribute). This variant demonstrates the adaptability of the bubble sort algorithm to different sorting needs.

### Characteristics:
- **Time Complexity:** O(n^2)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)
- **Style:** Iterative, uses custom comparator for flexible sorting
