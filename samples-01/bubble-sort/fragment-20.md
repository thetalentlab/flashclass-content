# Variant 20: Bubble Sort with Logging of the Sorting Process

This variant of bubble sort includes an option to log the state of the array after each swap. The `log` parameter controls whether the logging is enabled. When enabled, the function returns both the sorted array and a list of intermediate states, allowing you to trace the sorting process step by step.

### Characteristics:
- **Time Complexity:** O(n^2)
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) if logging is enabled, O(1) otherwise
- **Style:** Iterative, optional logging of the sorting process
