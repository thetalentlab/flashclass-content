# Variant 29: Bubble Sort with a Gap Sequence

This variant incorporates a gap sequence into the bubble sort algorithm, similar to the idea behind Shell sort. Elements separated by the gap are compared and swapped. This approach introduces a different way of managing comparisons, potentially leading to fewer swaps, though the overall time complexity remains O(n^2).

### Characteristics:
- **Time Complexity:** O(n^2)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)
- **Style:** Iterative, uses a gap sequence for sorting
