# Variant 14: Bubble Sort with Swap Count Tracing

This variant of bubble sort keeps track of the number of swaps made during the sorting process. In addition to returning the sorted array, it also returns the total number of swaps that were required to sort the array. This can provide insight into how "unsorted" the array was initially and serves as a basic metric for the efficiency of the sort.

### Characteristics:
- **Time Complexity:** O(n^2)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)
- **Style:** Iterative, tracks swap count
