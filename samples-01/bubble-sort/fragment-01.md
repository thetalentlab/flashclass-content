# Variant 1: Basic Bubble Sort

This is the basic implementation of the bubble sort algorithm. It iteratively steps through the list, compares adjacent pairs of elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This process repeats until the list is sorted. The algorithm continues to "bubble" the largest unsorted element to the end of the list with each pass through the array.

### Characteristics:
- **Time Complexity:** O(n^2)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)
- **Style:** Iterative, comparison-based
