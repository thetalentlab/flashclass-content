# Variant 22: Bubble Sort Using a Queue

This variant uses a deque (double-ended queue) to manage the unsorted portion of the array. While this doesn't change the fundamental logic of the bubble sort algorithm, it showcases the use of different data structures to manage the array, potentially useful in specific contexts where queue-like operations are beneficial.

### Characteristics:
- **Time Complexity:** O(n^2)
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) due to deque usage
- **Style:** Iterative, utilizes deque (queue)
