# Variant 10: Bubble Sort Using a Generator

This variant of bubble sort uses a generator to yield the array after each pass of the inner loop. The use of a generator allows the sorting process to be paused and resumed, which can be useful in contexts where you want to observe or process the array after each step of the sort.

### Characteristics:
- **Time Complexity:** O(n^2)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)
- **Style:** Iterative, uses generator for flow control
