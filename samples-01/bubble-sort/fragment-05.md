# Variant 5: Bubble Sort Using a While Loop

This variant of bubble sort replaces the `for` loops with `while` loops. The logic remains the same, but the use of `while` loops offers an alternative way to structure the iteration, which can sometimes be more flexible, especially in situations where the loop bounds may need to change dynamically.

### Characteristics:
- **Time Complexity:** O(n^2)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)
- **Style:** Iterative, while loop implementation
