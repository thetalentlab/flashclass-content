# Variant 23: Bubble Sort with Minimal Swaps

This variant modifies the bubble sort algorithm to focus on minimizing the number of swaps. Instead of swapping adjacent elements during each pass, it finds the minimum element in the unsorted portion and swaps it with the first unsorted element. This approach is closer to selection sort but retains the iterative nature of bubble sort.

### Characteristics:
- **Time Complexity:** O(n^2)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)
- **Style:** Iterative, minimizes swaps
