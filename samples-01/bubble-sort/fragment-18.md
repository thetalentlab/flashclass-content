# Variant 18: Bubble Sort Using a Random Pivot Element

This variant of bubble sort selects a random pivot element within the unsorted portion of the array during each pass. The algorithm then compares and swaps elements relative to this pivot, introducing an element of randomness into the sorting process. While it adds an interesting twist, it does not improve the algorithm's overall efficiency.

### Characteristics:
- **Time Complexity:** O(n^2)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)
- **Style:** Iterative, introduces randomness with a pivot element
