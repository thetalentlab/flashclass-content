# Variant 3: Reverse String Using Recursion

This variant uses recursion to reverse the string. The function calls itself with a substring that excludes the first character, and appends the first character at the end of the reversed substring.

### Characteristics:
- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) due to recursion stack
- **Style:** Recursive approach
