# Reverse String Using Map with Negative Indices

This variant uses the `map` function to iterate over a range of negative indices, constructing the reversed string by accessing characters from the end of the string.

### Characteristics:
- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(n)
- **Style:** Functional, uses map with negative indices
