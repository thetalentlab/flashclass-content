# Variant 2: Reverse String Using a Loop

This variant of the reverse string algorithm builds the reversed string character by character using a loop. It iterates over the original string and prepends each character to a new string.

### Characteristics:
- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(n)
- **Style:** Iterative, uses a loop to construct the reversed string
