# Variant 26: Reverse String Using Recursion and String Slicing

This variant combines recursion with string slicing to reverse the string. The function appends the last character of the string to the result of recursively reversing the rest of the string.

### Characteristics:
- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) due to recursion stack
- **Style:** Recursive, uses string slicing
