# Variant 4: Reverse String Using a Stack

This variant uses a stack to reverse the string. The stack's LIFO (Last In, First Out) property is used to pop characters in reverse order from how they were pushed onto the stack.

### Characteristics:
- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(n)
- **Style:** Iterative, uses stack data structure
