# Variant 11: Reverse String Using Recursion with Tail Call Optimization

This variant of the reverse string algorithm uses recursion with an accumulator to achieve tail call optimization. The function appends characters to the accumulator as it recursively reduces the string.

### Characteristics:
- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) due to recursion stack
- **Style:** Recursive, tail call optimization
