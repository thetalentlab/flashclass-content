# Variant 11: Binary Search Using NumPy

This variant utilizes the NumPy library to perform binary search. The `searchsorted` function from NumPy is used to find the insertion point for the `target` in the array. If the `target` is found at the insertion point, the index is returned; otherwise, `-1` is returned. This approach demonstrates how NumPy, a powerful numerical computing library, can be used to efficiently implement binary search in a single line of code.

### Characteristics:
- **Time Complexity:** O(log n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)
- **Style:** Utilizes NumPy for high-performance operations
