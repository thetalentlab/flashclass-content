# Binary Search Using NumPy

## Summary

This variant showcases the power of NumPy for high-performance numerical operations. Using `searchsorted`, the binary search is reduced to a concise and efficient implementation, making it ideal for scenarios where NumPy is already in use for other array-based computations.

## Description

This variant utilizes the NumPy library to perform binary search. The `searchsorted` function from NumPy is used to find the insertion point for the `target` in the array. If the `target` is found at the insertion point, the index is returned; otherwise, `-1` is returned. This approach demonstrates how NumPy, a powerful numerical computing library, can be used to efficiently implement binary search in a single line of code.

## Explanation

1. **Importing NumPy**:
   - The NumPy library is imported to leverage its efficient array operations. Specifically, the `searchsorted` function is used to perform binary search.

2. **Using `searchsorted`**:
   - The `searchsorted` function is called with the array `arr` and the `target` value. It returns the index at which the `target` should be inserted to maintain the sorted order of the array.
   - This function effectively performs a binary search to find this insertion point.

3. **Checking the Target**:
   - After obtaining the insertion point, the code checks whether the `target` is actually present at the calculated index.
   - If `index` is within the bounds of the array and `arr[index]` equals the `target`, the index is returned.
   - If the `target` is not found at the insertion point, the function returns `-1`.

## Characteristics

- **Time Complexity:** O(log n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)
- **Style:** Utilizes NumPy for high-performance operations
