# Variant 25: Binary Search with Manual Index Management

This variant returns to a more manual approach to binary search, with explicit management of the left, right, and mid indices. While this is close to the traditional binary search, it emphasizes the step-by-step process of index management, making it clearer for those learning the algorithm.

### Characteristics:
- **Time Complexity:** O(log n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)
- **Style:** Iterative, manual index management
