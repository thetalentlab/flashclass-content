# Variant 18: Binary Search with Custom Mid Calculation Using Logarithm

This variant calculates the middle index using a logarithmic function. The middle index is computed as `mid = left + math.ceil((right - left) / math.log2(len(arr)))`. This approach demonstrates how different mathematical functions can be used to calculate the midpoint, potentially leading to different behaviors in the search process. While not typically necessary for binary search, it illustrates the flexibility in choosing midpoint calculations.

### Characteristics:
- **Time Complexity:** O(log n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)
- **Style:** Iterative, custom midpoint calculation
