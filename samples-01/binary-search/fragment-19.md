# Variant 19: Binary Search with Descending Order

This variant of binary search is designed for arrays sorted in descending order, as opposed to the typical ascending order. The search logic is adjusted to account for the reversed ordering by swapping the comparisons: `arr[mid] > target` leads to the left boundary moving right, and `arr[mid] < target` leads to the right boundary moving left. This demonstrates how binary search can be adapted for different data orderings.

### Characteristics:
- **Time Complexity:** O(log n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)
- **Style:** Iterative, adapted for descending order arrays
