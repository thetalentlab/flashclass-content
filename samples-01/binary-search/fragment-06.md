# Variant 6: Binary Search Using Recursion with a Ternary Operator

This variant implements binary search using recursion and incorporates a ternary operator for more concise logic. The `helper` function performs the recursive search, and the ternary operator is used to determine the return value based on whether the `target` is found, should continue searching in the right half, or in the left half. This approach reduces the number of lines of code and showcases a more compact, albeit slightly more complex, implementation.

### Characteristics:
- **Time Complexity:** O(log n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(log n) due to recursive stack
- **Style:** Recursive, Pythonic, uses ternary operator
