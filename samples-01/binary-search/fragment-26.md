# Variant 26: Binary Search with Adaptive Midpoint Calculation

This variant uses an adaptive calculation for the midpoint based on the values of `target`, `arr[left]`, and `arr[right]`. The midpoint is adjusted according to the distribution of values in the array, potentially speeding up the search when values are not uniformly distributed. This can make the search more efficient in certain cases but is more complex and less general than the traditional midpoint calculation.

### Characteristics:
- **Time Complexity:** O(log n) in general cases, but can vary
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)
- **Style:** Iterative, adaptive midpoint calculation
