# Binary Search Using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

This variant implements binary search using an object-oriented approach. The `BinarySearch` class encapsulates the array and provides a `search` method to perform the binary search. This structure allows for the binary search functionality to be reused and extended, demonstrating the principles of encapsulation and abstraction in OOP.

### Characteristics:
- **Time Complexity:** O(log n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)
- **Style:** Object-oriented programming, reusable and extensible
