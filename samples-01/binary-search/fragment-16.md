# Binary Search Using a List for the Search Range

This variant of binary search represents the search range as a list, where the first element is `left` and the second element is `right`. This is a slight variation from the traditional use of separate variables for `left` and `right`. The logic remains the same, but the use of a list to represent the range offers a different perspective on how state can be managed during the search process.

### Characteristics:
- **Time Complexity:** O(log n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)
- **Style:** Iterative, uses list for range representation
