# Binary Search Using Recursion with Reversed Boundaries

This variant implements binary search with reversed boundaries, where the `left` and `right` indices start from the end and beginning of the array, respectively. The calculation of the middle index is also adjusted to reflect this reversal. The recursive logic remains similar to traditional binary search but is mirrored, making it an interesting variation that demonstrates the flexibility of recursion.

### Characteristics:
- **Time Complexity:** O(log n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(log n) due to recursive stack
- **Style:** Recursive, unconventional reversed boundaries
