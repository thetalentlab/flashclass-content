# Variant 30: Binary Search with Dynamic Adjustment of Search Bounds

This final variant dynamically adjusts the search bounds based on the distance between `left` and `right`. Instead of the typical linear adjustment, this version allows for larger or smaller steps depending on how close the target is estimated to be, using a quarter-step adjustment. This could potentially speed up the search in cases where the distribution of the target within the array is non-uniform.

### Characteristics:
- **Time Complexity:** O(log n) in general cases, but can vary
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)
- **Style:** Iterative, dynamic search bound adjustment
