# Variant 27: Binary Search Using a Dictionary to Store Search History

In this variant, a dictionary is used to store the indices and their corresponding values during the search. This is more of a pedagogical approach to show how one could track the search history. It doesn't offer performance benefits but demonstrates how you can capture intermediate states in an algorithm, which can be useful for debugging or analysis.

### Characteristics:
- **Time Complexity:** O(log n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(log n) due to the dictionary
- **Style:** Iterative, tracks search history in a dictionary
