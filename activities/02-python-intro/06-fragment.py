Developers often compare software to a machine or robot that carries out the goals set by the program. This helps create a mental image of what the software is doing when it's running.

Software development has two key phases:

1. Design Time  -- This is when the developer writes the software.

2. Run Time     -- This is when the software is actually running, performing tasks.


A professional developer frequently switches between these two phasesâ€”writing a few lines of code, then running the software to check if it behaves as expected.
