Deciding which programming language to use ...


1. Who Knows It?

The popularity of a language affects how easy it is to find developers who know how to use it. The more people that know a language, the easier (and often cheaper) it is to hire them.

Popular languages also tend to evolve faster because more people are contributing to them. More attention means more innovation.


2. What Can You Do With It?

Different languages are better suited for different tasks. The more widely used a language is, the more tools and resources are available to support it. This means it's easier to find the right tools for the job.
