At its core, the text of any software describes three key things:

1. Data      -- This is where most of the value is

2. Decisions -- Also called "branches," this is where the software makes choices.

3. Loops     -- These are repeated actions, and can be either "iterative" (repeating in steps) or "recursive" (repeating within itself).
