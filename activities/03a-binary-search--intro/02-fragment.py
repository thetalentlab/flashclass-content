"""

"Array" is the name of a collection of things, like an egg carton with 1 row of eggs

Notice the array is sorted, lowest numbers at the left, biggest at the right.

Dictionaries are sorted alphabetically.  Imagine if they were not sorted!

A sorted array is the required input to the binary search algorithm.
