"""

Binary Search is an efficient algorithm to find a target value in a sorted array.

It operates by repeatedly dividing the search space in half, reducing the number of elements to be checked.

It's like searching for a word in a dictionary.

Instead of flipping through every page, you open the dictionary in the middle and see if the word comes before or after that page, then discard the half that doesnâ€™t contain the word.

    # inside the machine we can write other code

    print(haystack) # to print out the haystack
