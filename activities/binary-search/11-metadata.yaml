long_description: This variant showcases the power of NumPy for high-performance numerical operations as is common in AI and Machine Learning applications. Using `searchsorted`, the binary search is reduced to a concise and efficient implementation, making it ideal for scenarios where NumPy is already in use for other array-based computations.
