So flashclass starts with the assumption that learning depends on 3 things:


1. What you already KNOW coming into the lesson

  ... learning can be inductive (when we're on completely new ground)
  or deductive (when we extend what we already know)


2. What you PERCEIVE in the lesson

  ... breadth, depth and quality of the lesson content help us build
  a rich heuristic around the topics we care most about


3. What you FEEL during the lesson

  ... our emotional and mental state has a massive impact on our ability
  to remember and apply what we learn
