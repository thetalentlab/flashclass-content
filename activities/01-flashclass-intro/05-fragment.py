"""

flashclass starts with the assumption that learning depends on 3 things:


1. What we already KNOW coming into the lesson

  ... learning can be inductive (when you're on completely new ground)
  or deductive (when you extend what you already know)


2. What we PERCEIVE in the lesson

  ... breadth, depth and quality of the lesson content help you build
  a rich heuristic around the topic you care most about


3. What we FEEL during the lesson

  ... our emotional and mental state has a massive impact on our ability
  to remember and apply what we learn
