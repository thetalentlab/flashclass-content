flashclass is a new system of learning that throws you into the deep end
of whichever pool you want to swim in most.

flashclass helps you stay afloat, just barely, until you get comfortable with the confusion.


For example, flashclass has already asked 2 questions:

1. how do you prefer to learn (reading, watching, listening, etc)
2. what change, or transformation, are you looking for? (today you know ABC, tomorrow you will know XYZ)


Based on your preferences, flashclass is, right now, building a custom course just for you.

You will find it on your DASHBOARD
