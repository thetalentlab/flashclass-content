Books, courses and classes are a HUGE investment of time as well as money.

And there are so many options!

It's almost impossible to choose.



At the same time, there are some really big problems with education today:

- No one ASKS you about what you already know ... you are a blank slate
- No one OFFERS beginners any serious breadth or depth ... your speed is limited
- No one NOTICES how you feel during the lesson ... you are a transaction
