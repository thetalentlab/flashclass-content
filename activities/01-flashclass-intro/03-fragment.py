At the same time, there are some really big, common problems with the way
education works today.


- No one ASKS about what you already know

  ... the assumption is you are a blank slate, just like everyone else,
  because it's easier to design courses like that.



- No one OFFERS content of any serious breadth or depth for beginners

  ... only the same small, boring nibbles over and over, because it's
  cheaper to bring new customers to old lessons than to try something new



- No one NOTICES your emotional and mental state during the lesson

  ... unless you find a teacher that takes an interest, and even then it
  can lead to teacher burnout, something like "empathy fatigue"
