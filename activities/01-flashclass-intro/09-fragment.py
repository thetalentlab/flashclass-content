Courses are called "sessions" and you can retake these sessions
as many times as you want, no limit

A session is a collection of "activities", like little games or
challenges that you play with yourself just by paying attention


The orientation session is now finished


As you continue, be sure to lean in and embrace the confusion,
like a playful child on a sunny day in the park,
there is so much to learn!

Try to stay focused on the challenge at hand,
... sometimes just looking and taking it in, other times answering questions.


Hope this helps!
