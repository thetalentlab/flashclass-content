- No one ASKS you about what you already know ... you are a blank slate


  ... unless they break the mold, the assumption is you are a blank slate,
  just like everyone else because it's easier (and usually more profitable)
  to design courses like that.


- No one OFFERS beginners any serious breadth or depth

- No one NOTICES how you feel during the lesson
