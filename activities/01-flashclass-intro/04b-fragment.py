- No one ASKS you about what you already know

- No one OFFERS beginners any serious breadth or depth ... your speed is limited


  ... unless it's a friendly source of learning, all you get are the same small,
  boring examples over and over, because it's more profitable to bring new customers
  to old lessons than to try something totally new


- No one NOTICES how you feel during the lesson
