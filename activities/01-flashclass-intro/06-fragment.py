Here's an idea:

  "There is no speed limit to learning."


Imagine a mother telling her baby,

  "OK, that's enough learning for today.  No more new words for you, little one."


That would be ridiculous, of course, because we're not testing babies for recall.

We just assume babies learn, naturally, through massive, consistent EXPOSURE to new material.

But we forget that WE TOO can learn like that.
