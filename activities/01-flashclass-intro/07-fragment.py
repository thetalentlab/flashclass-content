"""

The key is to welcome and accept the feeling of being CONFUSED
... instead of fighting or avoiding it.


Most of us learned to connect being confused with anxiety in school because of tests,
grades and awards.

It's only natural: we learned to avoid the things that hurt us, our grades,
our reputation and future opportunities like college and a well-paying job.

Confusion was basically a "Bad Thing" during all of our schooling.



But we can renew our relationship with confusion and learn to embrace that feeling
of being confused as a sign that we are in new territory.  "How fun!", we could say.



Confusion is, in fact, the last recognizable milestone before we learn something new.

In other words, confusion is the sign that we are about to learn.
